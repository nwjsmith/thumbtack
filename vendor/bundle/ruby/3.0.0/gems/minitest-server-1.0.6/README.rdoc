== DESCRIPTION:

minitest-server provides a client/server setup with your minitest
process, allowing your test run to send its results directly to a
handler.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Written as a minitest plugin. Everything is automatic.
* Uses drb for all communication. Clean and easy!

== SYNOPSIS:

There really is nothing to show here as you don't really USE
minitest-server directly. See minitest-bisect and minitest-autotest
for real-world examples.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* minitest 5+

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install minitest-server

== LICENSE:
